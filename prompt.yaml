  ### Summary Field
  For each reported outcome in the RCT, provide the evaluation results in the following format for the "summary":

  Only return a CSV entry with exactly the following columns, all lowercase:

  ["criteria a", "criteria b",
   "criteria c.1", "criteria c.2", "criteria c.3", "criteria c.4", "criteria c.5",
   "criteria d", "criteria e", "criteria f"]

  Example summary CSV entry:
  probably no,probably no,probably yes,probably yes,probably no,na,probably yes,probably yes,probably yes,definitely yes

  Important:
  - Return one row only, comma-separated.
  - Exactly 10 values in the order listed above.
  - Each sub-criterion (c.1-c.5) must have its own value.
  - If unsure or no information is available, write "na".
  - Never add or remove columns.
  - Never merge multiple values into one field.
